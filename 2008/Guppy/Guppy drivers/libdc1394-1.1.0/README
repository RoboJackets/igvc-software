                   =========================================

1. About the 1394-Based Digital Camera Control Library

This library provides functionality to control any camera that conforms to the
1394-Based Digital Camera Specification (which can be found at
http://www.1394ta.org/Download/Technology/Specifications/Camera120.pdf).  It
utilizes the lowlevel functionality provided by libraw1394 to communicate with
the camera.
