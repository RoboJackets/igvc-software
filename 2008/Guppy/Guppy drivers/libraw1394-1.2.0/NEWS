Version 1.2.0:
- added constants useful for ARM: transaction and response return codes.
- added raw1394_bandwidth_modify() and raw1394_channel_modify().

Version 1.1.0:
- added ability to specify the isochronous receive mode in the new
  rawiso (raw1394_iso_*) API. Therefore, the signature of 
  raw1394_iso_recv_init() changed, and likewise, the libtool/.so version
  numbers changed to reflect a new interface that is not backwards compatible!
- added raw1394_arm_set_buf() and raw1394_arm_get_buf() functions.
- added raw1394_new_handle_on_port() to make initialization simpler.
- make versioning consistent and updated. 1.0.0 was reported by pkg-config in 
  0.10 series; hence, 1.1.0 in this release.
- removed outdated, bogus "linking required only" version symbols in 
  version.c - use pkg-config now.
- dropped libraw1394.m4 - use pkg-config now.
- added RPM spec file.
- deprecate old isochronous API.
- move API comment documentation to header and reformat header comments as
  kernel-doc (use linux/scripts/kernel-doc to extract and format them).
- updated tools/dumpiso and tools/sendiso to new isochronous API.

Version 0.10:

- merged in the rawiso branch
- add sendiso and dumpiso tools with man files
- fix wrong error mapping on local transactions in raw1394_errcode_to_errno().
- added comment headers for most exported functions
- merged in weihs branch which brings new functionality including address
  range mapping, reading and writing configROM images, additional bus reset
  handling, and others.

Version 0.9:

- error reporting reworked to be more C library style; functions affected are
  mainly raw1394_read(), raw1394_write(), raw1394_lock;
  Source incompatibility!  Parts need to be adapted in application code, but
  it's well worth it.
- the generation number is not unconditionally updated on bus reset in the event
  loop anymore, the new function raw1394_update_generation() has to be used
  (unless the default bus reset handler is used) so that transactions won't fail
- iso handlers used to get the iso header quadlet in host endian, now they get
  it in big endian like the rest of the packet for consistency
- testlibraw gets installed now, man page also included
- (not yet complete) documentation in Docbook format included
- libraw1394.m4 autoconf macro added

Version 0.8:

- added libraw1394/ieee1394.h with useful defines (especially ack and rcodes)
- function to query isochronous resource manager ID
- functions for isochronous sending
- new raw1394_reset_bus() function to reset the bus

Version 0.7:

- added support for environments where the kernel runs in 64 bit mode whereas
  user space runs in 32 bit mode
- fixed lock transaction to actually return the required response; these
  functions are actually useful now, prototypes for raw1394_start_lock and
  raw1394_lock changed
- a void pointer can now be stored as user data with a handle

Version 0.6:

- FCP monitoring added
- not really libraw1394 news: the subsystem doesn't swap data anymore,
  everything is to be kept big endian now on all architectures

Version 0.5:

- there are now separate iso handlers for each channel

Version 0.4:

- isochronous receive support

Version 0.3:

- first release of new libraw1394 for new raw1394 driver
- supports 1394 async reads/writes
- maintainer: Andreas Bombe <andreas.bombe@munich.netsurf.de>
