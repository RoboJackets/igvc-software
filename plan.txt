Terminology:
	goal = waypoint in distance

Problem:
	as we get closer to goal, we plan too much and the path planner constantly thinks it has found a better path


Possible solutions:
	replan less often overall
	check if there are obstacles we are avoiding? if not, then replan less often
	figure out why it's oscillating and change that logic
		it thinks the new path is better, so why does it think that?
	compare to the previous path that is currently being followed (adjusted for movement since then) and decide if the new path is that much better (but how much?)
	
	
Things to be aware of:
	path is constantly being replanning at the moment (order of miliseconds)
