/**
The graph contains the nodes and cells that set the foundation of the search
problem.

In Field D*, Nodes are located on the corners of grid cells (as opposed to the
center, like in A*, D*, or D*lite).

The Graph object provides an interface for the occupancy grid, as well as nodes.
To facilitate the search problem, the graph operates under a unit-cell assumption,
meaning that each cell has side lengths of 1m. The `resolution_` field specifies
the conversion between the unit cell and the actual cell dimensions. i.e. if resolution_
is 0.2 then each cell actually has side dimensions of 0.2m.
