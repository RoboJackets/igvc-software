* Merge Conflicts
- Two weeks ago, we talked about branches and how they can be used to avoid
  conflicts in the code
- But sometimes, multiple people edit the same lines of code on the same branch. Git's
  powerful, but it's not magic.
- A merge conflict occurs when you try to push code based on an old version
  of the software that conflicts with changes in the same lines already
  pushed.

* What does a merge conflict look like
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Demonstrate example by setting up merge conflict beforehand, use the exact stuff on this slide
#+END_NOTES
#+BEGIN_SRC
some source code...
<<<<<< HEAD
This is a change I made
==========
This is a different change someone else made in the same place
>>>>>> The hash of the other commit, something like fa54dd6f3...
The rest of the source that had not been touched
#+END_SRC
- When you pull changes that lead to a merge conflict Git will notify which
  files have a merge conflict in them
- In each file, Git inserts the above text to indicate a merge conflict
- "This is a change I made" is in the branch you're on
- "This is a different change..." is from the branch you're merging

* So how do we deal with this?
- One strategy is to just go through the file and manually reconcile the
  conflict
- After compiling and testing your changes to make sure the new code works, you
  have to commit your merge resolution before being able to push your
  changes.

$ git mergetool -t kdiff3
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Use the up/down arrows (with the red tip) to navigate between conflicts
- "Base" is the most recent common version of the file 
- "Local" is the current version of the file in the working tree
- "Remote" is the version of the file being merged in from another branch / remote

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Select the different versions of the conflicted area using the A, B, and C buttons
- You can select more than one of these options, and kdiff3 will insert the different versions in the order you select the buttons.
- You can always edit the final (merged) version of the file in the bottom section.
