* What is Git?
- Git is a "Distributed Version Control System" (DVCS)
- It is the tool RoboJackets uses to collaborate on code
- Git tracks changes made to files in your project, so you can access old versions at any time without fear
- Allows multiple developers to work on the same code
- Working on different parts of code and then combining them creates unique challenges that
  cannot be handled by file sharing systems like Dropbox and Google Drive

* What is GitHub?

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Publicly hosted Git server means that it has a bunch of Git repositories on its computers, just like how you will have Git repositories on your own computer
#+END_NOTES
- Git \neq GitHub
- GitHub is a publicly hosted Git server
- It hosts our projects as "repositories" on the internet
    - A repository is a group of files that Git collectively tracks
- This saves us the hassle of hosting a server for fellow RoboJackets to
  obtain copies of the code
- As you matriculate through Tech, you'll be building an online portfolio of
  your work on GitHub

* How do you find things on GitHub?
- Repositories are stored at =https://github.com/<ORG-OR-USER-NAME>/<REPO-NAME>=
- So all of our projects can be found at https://github.com/RoboJackets
- Your personal projects will exist at =https://github.com/<YOUR-GH-USERNAME>=

** Create a GitHub account
- [[https://github.com/join%0A][https://github.com/join]]
- Please include /at least/ your real first name
# Emphasize this requirement is for display name on GitHub, not username

* Fork and star our repo
- Navigate to https://github.com/RoboJackets/software-training

* What is a fork?
- Problem: How do I try something out on a project without affecting the project itself?
- Solution: Forks!
- A fork is a copy of a repository that exists on your personal account
- Changes made on a fork will not affect the original repository, and vice versa
- Your fork will be present on =https://github.com/<YOUR-GH-USERNAME>/software-training=

* Install Git on your computer
- Windows: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Mac OS:
    - Install Homebrew first from https://brew.sh/
    - Then run: ~brew install git~
- Ubuntu:
    - Run ~sudo apt install git~

* Git Config
- These commands set up git to attribute your contributions to our code to you.
# third command verifies that things are working

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "your@email.here"
    # verify the change above was set
    git config --get --global user.email
    git config --get --global user.name
  #+END_SRC

* Let's grab some code!
- Go back to the webpage for our GitHub repository
- Select the clone button, then copy the link displayed

** Clone the repository
- In your terminal navigate to your workspace

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git clone <PASTE-CLIPBOARD-CONTENTS-HERE>
  #+END_SRC

- If using Linux, use Ctrl-Shift-V to paste in terminal
- Tada! Your own working copy of RoboJackets code!

* Adding Remotes
- These commands set you up to separately contribute to your fork while receiving updates from the original repository
- You can find the link in the last command under the green 'clone or download' button on your FORK

# Emphasize that the brackets are to be replaced
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  cd ~/<REPOSITORY-FOLDER>
  git remote add rj https://github.com/RoboJackets/software-training.git
  git remote set-url origin https://github.com/<YOUR-GH-USERNAME>/software-training.git
  git remote -v

#+END_SRC

** Checking Remotes
Now when you do:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git remote -v
#+END_SRC
You should see:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
origin  https://github.com/<YOUR-GH-USERNAME>/software-training.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/<YOUR-GH-USERNAME>/software-training.git (push)
rj  https://github.com/RoboJackets/software-training.git (fetch)
rj  https://github.com/RoboJackets/software-training.git (push)
#+END_SRC
