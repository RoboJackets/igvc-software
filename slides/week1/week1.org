* Why are you here?
- Learn the basics of software development
- Get up to speed on technologies and techniques common to most RoboJackets teams
- Have a go-to place to ask questions ([[https://piazza.com/gatech/fall2017/rjsw/home][Piazza!]])

* The Linux terminal
- Powerful text-based interface for interacting with your computer
- (Almost) everything is a file
- Every file is part of one big tree
- Lots of tiny tools you can chain together to do useful things

* Basic commands
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Explain that a directory is more commonly called a folder. Go to your home directory. Create a directory. cd to it. Use echo to create a file. List the files with ls -al. Explain what . and .. are. Remove the file. cd up a level. Remove the directory.
#+END_NOTES
| Command | Use |
|-------+------|
| =cd= | Change to a different directory |
| =ls=  | List files in this directory |
| =mkdir= | Make a new directory |
| =rm= | Remove a file |
| =rmdir= | Remove a directory |
| =echo= | Write arguments to the standard output |

* Basic commands
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Create a directory with a file again, copy the file to the same folder with a different name, move the original up a level. Run man grep. Grep your file for a keyword. Run history.
#+END_NOTES
| Command | Use |
|-------+------|
| =cp= | Copy a file |
| =mv= | Move a file |
| =man= | Access documentation about a command |
| =grep= | Search for a string |
| =history= | Shows your command history |

* Basic hotkeys
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Copy/paste are generally ctrl+shift+c/ctrl+shift+v, respectively, but varies by shell.
#+END_NOTES
- *Up/down arrow keys:* Cycle through your command history (great for recent commands)
- *Ctrl+R:* Search through your command history (great for less recent commands)
- *Tab:* Complete this command/file/directory name
- *Tab-Tab:* Show possible completions
- *Ctrl+C:* /NOT COPY!/ Stops the current command.
- *Ctrl+Z:* /NOT UNDO!/ Sends the current command to the background.
 - Use =fg= to bring it back to the foreground.
- *Ctrl+D:* Exit the shell.

* Example code
- It's all on the software training GitHub repository
- Same code in 3 different languages - you should be able to understand at least one by now
- Look at the cpp file and try to understand it if you've never written C++ before

* Git
#+BEGIN_NOTES
Time to switch to the Git/GitHub presentation.
#+END_NOTES
- [[file:git.org][Click here for this week's Git presentation]]
