# Add Noise to Simulation

*Issue #552*

## The Problem

The problem I am trying to solve is how to add noise to the gazebo simulation. This problem is important because in real life, the sensor readings are not always perfect, so the simulation needs to be able to recreate this.

## Proposed Solution

I am going to simulate noise for the x and y position of the robot using a random normal distribution

- add normal distribution randomizer
- add noise to x pose and y pose
- have it so the randomizer's standard deviaion can be set in the launch file(simulation.launch)

## Questions & Research

I need to figure out how to use implement normal distributions in c++

I also need to re-learn how launch files work in terms of which file I will add the parameter to.

## Overall Scope

### Affected Packages

- igvc_gazebo
    - ground_truth/main.cpp
    - simulation.launch

### Schedule

Subtask 1 (2/xx/22): Create a normal distribution randomizer and use it to add noise to x pose and y pose

Subtask 2 (2/xx/22): Make it so that the standard deviation can be set in the launch files

Code Review: (2/xx/22)
