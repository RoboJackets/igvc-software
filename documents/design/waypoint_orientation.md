# Final orientation of waypoint for TEB is wrong

*Issue 596*

## The Problem

Currently the waypoint programming gives each waypoint a goal orientation of 0 degrees. This
means that at each waypoint the robot turns to face 0 degrees before moving on.

## Proposed Solution

The solution to this problem would be to change the message type of `/waypoint` from `PointStamped`
to `PoseStamped`, and then make the action server (or itself) send the pose directly instead of a point with 
an orientation of yaw = 0.

To calculate the intended waypoint orientation, the program will first send the waypoint with yaw =0
wait until the robot is within a certain radius of the waypoint, defined with the 
parameter `waypoint_radius`, then send the waypoint again but with an orientation such that the robot just 
has to go in a straight line from the circle circumference.

Another aspect that can be fixed is to merge the `action_server.cpp` and `waypoint_source.cpp` into a
new node called `navigation_client.cpp`. Since the two files are solely dependent on each other, 
their functionality can be merged into a single file. 

There will be a parameter called `reading_from_file` that defines if the node will only send waypoints 
from a file or from rviz. If true, it will only send waypoints from a file and ignore any waypoints sent
by rviz. If false, it will not read from any file and only send waypoints from rviz.

The `navigation_client.cpp` node would:
- check if it reading waypoints from a file with the parameter `reading_from_file`

If reading from a file
- read waypoints from the path defined by the parameter `path` 
- create a list of `PoseStamped` which correspond to each waypoint
- use `sendGoalAndWait()` to send the waypoint to the navigation server
- when navigation is finished, send the next waypoint, repeat

If reading from rviz
- subscribe to rviz waypoint topic
- use `sendGoal()` in callback function

## Questions & Research

None.
