# Project Title

*Issue #567*
(What GitHub issue is associated with this project)

**Author:**
- Christopher Lo

## The Problem

- The ROS package move_base_flex serves to allow the robot to utilize an enhanced version of 
the planner, controller, and recovery plugin ROS interfaces:

- There is a better path planner algorithm, D* lite which builds upon the Lifelong
Planning A* (LPA) algorithm and D* algorithms. 

- Thus, to resolve this issue, I will be replacing the currently used A* algorithm with the 
better D* lite algorithm in order to improve Jessii's path planning on the obstacle course.

## Proposed Solution

- Read a research paper on D* lite by researchers Sven Koenig and
Maxim Likhachev in order to understand the technical details behind Lifelong Planning A* and D* Lite for
robot navigation in unknown terrain. 

- Includes goal-directed navigation and the mapping of unknown terrain, concepts that will be useful to 
understand when implementingthe D* lite algorithm. 

- Read up on move_base_flex, a ROS package responsible for the planning, control, and recovery features
for Jessii.

- Read up on the parameters used by the method that will contain the D* lite algorithm implementation within
the software base.

- Create an implementation using the parameters and concepts learned from the D* lite research paper.

- Run tests using a simulator and see if the planner works better than the A* algorithm currently in place.

## Questions & Research

- I do not know much about D* Lite (which is why I will be reading the research paper to extract
information that will be essential for creating a working implementation of the algorithm). 

- I will need to read up on A* and LPA (Lifelong Planning A*) in order to understand why D* Lite 
is better than these algorithms and how I can seamlessly reap the benefits.

## Overall Scope

### Affected Packages

- The parts of the software that I will have to change are the:

- move_base_flex wrapper_global_planner.h file containing the makePlan() method that will ultimately be 
responsible for holding my D* lite algorithm implementation.

- Planner core file within the navigation folder in order to render a map of the unknown terrain that Jessii
will be crossing and using to calculate a path with the D* lite algorithm.

### Schedule

Subtask 1 (11/24/2019): Read up on the D* Lite research paper. (11/24/2019)

Subtask 2 (11/31/2019): Read up on move_base_flex package and methods used in the body of the method containing the 
D* Lite algorithm. 

Subtask 3 (01/01/2020): Create an implementation of the D* Lite algorithm in the method. (01/01/2020)

Subtask 4 (01/10/2020): Run tests on the newly implemented D* Lite algorithm using a simulator or actual Jessii.

Code Review (1/15/2020): Code/result will be ready to review
