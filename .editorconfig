# IGVC base editorconfig

# Editorconfig files are recursive, so if you want to add specifc rules for
# your subdirectory, make a file like this in that directory.

# Lots of configuration is supported, like max line length, and charset.

# for more information look at http://editorconfig.org/. There are
# plugins available for almost every text editor!

# For an easy install of the sublime editorconfig package, go to:
# PackageControl -> Install Package -> EditorConfig
