# TicTacToe Game

This week, we'll walk you through writing a class to represent a TicTacToe game. The end result will be a command line game you can play against a randomized computer player. Once this works, you'll have a chance to replace the random algorithm with your own algorithm to try to make an unbeatable TicTacToe player.

## How to Build

Open this folder as a project in CLion to build and run the game.
