 * **igvc_navigation**
    *Collection of nodes that form our navigation stack*
 * **igvc_perception**
    *Collection of nodes that form our perception stack, most notably the line detector*
 * **igvc_platform**
    *Nodes that are platform specific and used to communicate with the hardware, ie. IMU, joystick and motor controller*
 * **igvc_rviz_plugins**
    *RVIZ plugins that provide visualization for our stack.*

## Building Code
 For an installation guide for ROS, check out the
 [installation guide on the RoboJackets wiki](https://wiki.robojackets.org/IGVC_Software_Installation_Instructions).
 
1. Clone the repository (with the git submodules) into the src directory of a catkin workspace:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RoboJackets/igvc-software --recursive
    ```

2. Use `catkin_make` in the workspace to build all the packages:
    ```bash
    catkin_make
    ```

3. Make sure the `devel/setup.bash` is sourced before using any of the nodes in this package:
    ```bash
   source devel/setup.bash
    ```


## Running Gazebo
You can get started with the IGVC code base right away by launching our simulator!

**Load up Jessii:**
The following command will load our platform into a simulated IGVC qualifications course:
```
roslaunch igvc_gazebo qualification.launch
```

**Navigation the course:**
To launch the navigation stack for simulation:
```bash
roslaunch igvc_navigation navigation_simulation.launch
```

Alternatively, you can control the robot manually with a USB gamepad with this command:
```
roslaunch igvc joystick_driver.launch
```
