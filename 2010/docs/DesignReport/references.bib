                  algorithm, but is in fact an elegant computation on
                  a factor graph. By computing a rooted clique tree on
                  this graph, the computation can be parallelized
                  across subtrees, which forms the basis of so-called
                  multifrontal QR methods. By judiciously choosing the
                  order in which variables are eliminated in the
                  clique tree computation, we show that one
                  straightforwardly obtains a method for performing
                  inference in distributed sensor networks. One
                  obvious application is distributed localization and
                  mapping with a team of robots. We phrase the problem
                  as inference on a large-scale Gaussian Markov Random
                  Field induced by the measurement factor graph, and
                  show how multifrontal QR on this graph solves for
                  the global map and all the robot poses in a
                  distributed fashion. The method is illustrated using
                  both small and large-scale simulations, and
                  validated in practice through actual robot
                  experiments.},

                  optimization problem into a sequence of smaller

                  logical order to this sequence, and each subproblem
                  involves only two variables. Nonserial dynamic
                  programming is a generalization of this; typically
                  the decomposition yields subproblems involving three
                  or more variables and there is no logical order to
                  the sequence of these subproblems, but the principle
                  of optimality can still be applied to yield
                  computational savings. This book is a comprehensive
                  study of discrete deterministic nonserial dynamic

                  minimize the computational effort. Throughout,
